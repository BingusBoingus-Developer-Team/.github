## Hi there 👋
- 🤖 I moved repo ownerships to this organization to keep working on it as a team.
- 🙋‍♀️ We are currently maintaining these repositories as a duo but are looking for more collaborators and contributors to add more fun functionality to the bot.
- 🌈 New feature ideas, requests and bug reports are always welcome.
- 👩‍💻 We will try to push out new features and fixes whenever we find the time and motivation to do so.


## Note

- some deprecated BingusBoingus Images can be found [on the old package registry](https://github.com/users/sanriodev/packages/container/package/bingusboingu) for anyone interested in older versions

##### kind regards, Matteo 🧙
